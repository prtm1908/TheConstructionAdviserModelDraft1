Section 18 Spreading rate, paint coverage and paint usage
In general terms, this means that paint when correctly applied, i.e., not unnecessarily thinned, brushed out too thinly, or applied too heavily, will cover the area stated on the paint container provided that the surface is essentially non-absorbent. Where surfaces are
absorbent more paint will be used and it is difficult to assess paint usage requirements with a high degree of accuracy. The complete obliteration of the colour of a substrate will not necessarily occur with a single coat applied at the stated spreading rating.

NSW Defect Guide
13.2 Surface Finish of paintwork
Paintwork is defective if the application has blemishes such as paint runs, paint sags, wrinkling, dust, bare or starved painted areas, colour variations, surface cracks, irregular and coarse brush marks, sanding marks, blistering, non-uniformity of gloss level and other irregularities in the surface that are visible from a normal viewing position.","Set up the work area;

AS2311 Painting of Buildings
Section 18 Spreading rate, paint coverage and paint usage
In general terms, this means that paint when correctly applied, i.e., not unnecessarily thinned, brushed out too thinly, or applied too heavily, will cover the area stated on the paint container provided that the surface is essentially non-absorbent. Where surfaces are
absorbent more paint will be used and it is difficult to assess paint usage requirements with a high degree of accuracy. The complete obliteration of the colour of a substrate will not necessarily occur with a single coat applied at the stated spreading rating.


NSW Defect Guide
13.2 Surface Finish of paintwork
Paintwork is defective if the application has blemishes such as paint runs, paint sags, wrinkling, dust, bare or starved painted areas, colour variations, surface cracks, irregular and coarse brush marks, sanding marks, blistering, non-uniformity of gloss level and other irregularities in the surface that are visible from a normal viewing position.","Set up the work area;

8.7 Moisture Management
Moisture ingress and condensation is one of the most common causes of defects in Australian buildings today. A drained and ventilated façade cavity is recognised as best practice in providing a high level of moisture management. The Vitradual details reflect this, with openings at top and bottom of walls designed to encourage air flow and allow the cavity to remove any condensation or other moisture.
Where an open cavity is not achievable (such as a window head or base of a fascia), it is recommended weep holes be provided. These are 10mm diameter, located 600mm apart. Note that in areas where there is no condensation risk weep holes may not be required.
Details 4,7 & 11 include provision for drainage of liquid water, this can be disregarded if the wall system adequately treats this elsewhere.

In general terms, this means that paint when correctly applied, i.e., not unnecessarily thinned, brushed out too thinly, or applied too heavily, will cover the area stated on the paint container provided that the surface is essentially non-absorbent. Where surfaces are
absorbent more paint will be used and it is difficult to assess paint usage requirements with a high degree of accuracy. The complete obliteration of the colour of a substrate will not necessarily occur with a single coat applied at the stated spreading rating.

13.2 Surface Finish of paintwork

Paintwork is defective if the application has blemishes such as paint runs, paint sags, wrinkling, dust, bare or starved painted areas, colour variations, surface cracks, irregular and coarse brush marks, sanding marks, blistering, non-uniformity of gloss level and other irregularities in the surface that are visible from a normal viewing position.","Set up the work area;

Section 18 Spreading rate, paint coverage and paint usage

In general terms, this means that paint when correctly applied, i.e., not unnecessarily thinned, brushed out too thinly, or applied too heavily, will cover the area stated on the paint container provided that the surface is essentially non-absorbent. Where surfaces are
absorbent more paint will be used and it is difficult to assess paint usage requirements with a high degree of accuracy. The complete obliteration of the colour of a substrate will not necessarily occur with a single coat applied at the stated spreading rating.

13.2 Surface Finish of paintwork

Paintwork is defective if the application has blemishes such as paint runs, paint sags, wrinkling, dust, bare or starved painted areas, colour variations, surface cracks, irregular and coarse brush marks, sanding marks, blistering, non-uniformity of gloss level and other irregularities in the surface that are visible from a normal viewing position.","Set up the work area;

Section 18 Spreading rate, paint coverage and paint usage

In general terms, this means that paint when correctly applied, i.e., not unnecessarily thinned, brushed out too thinly, or applied too heavily, will cover the area stated on the paint container provided that the surface is essentially non-absorbent. Where surfaces are
absorbent more paint will be used and it is difficult to assess paint usage requirements with a high degree of accuracy. The complete obliteration of the colour of a substrate will not necessarily occur with a single coat applied at the stated spreading rating.

absorbent more paint will be used and it is difficult to assess paint usage requirements with a high degree of accuracy. The complete obliteration of the colour of a substrate will not necessarily occur with a single coat applied at the stated spreading rating.

AS2311 Painting of Buildings

Section 18 Spreading rate, paint coverage and paint usage

In general terms, this means that paint when correctly applied, i.e., not unnecessarily thinned, brushed out too thinly, or applied too heavily, will cover the area stated on the paint container provided that the surface is essentially non-absorbent. Where surfaces are
absorbent more paint will be used and it is difficult to assess paint usage requirements with a high degree of accuracy. The complete obliteration of the colour of a substrate will not necessarily occur with a single coat applied at the stated spreading rating.


NSW Defect Guide
13.2 Surface Finish of paintwork
Paintwork is defective if the application has blemishes such as paint runs, paint sags, wrinkling, dust, bare or starved painted areas, colour variations, surface cracks, irregular and coarse brush marks, sanding marks, blistering, non-uniformity of gloss level and other irregularities in the surface that are visible from a normal viewing position.","Set up the work area;

In general terms, this means that paint when correctly applied, i.e., not unnecessarily thinned, brushed out too thinly, or applied too heavily, will cover the area stated on the paint container provided that the surface is essentially non-absorbent. Where surfaces are
absorbent more paint will be used and it is difficult to assess paint usage requirements with a high degree of accuracy. The complete obliteration of the colour of a substrate will not necessarily occur with a single coat applied at the stated spreading rating.

absorbent more paint will be used and it is difficult to assess paint usage requirements with a high degree of accuracy. The complete obliteration of the colour of a substrate will not necessarily occur with a single coat applied at the stated spreading rating.

Section 18 Spreading rate, paint coverage and paint usage

In general terms, this means that paint when correctly applied, i.e., not unnecessarily thinned, brushed out too thinly, or applied too heavily, will cover the area stated on the paint container provided that the surface is essentially non-absorbent. Where surfaces are
absorbent more paint will be used and it is difficult to assess paint usage requirements with a high degree of accuracy. The complete obliteration of the colour of a substrate will not necessarily occur with a single coat applied at the stated spreading rating.

13.2 Surface Finish of paintwork

Paintwork is defective if the application has blemishes such as paint runs, paint sags, wrinkling, dust, bare or starved painted areas, colour variations, surface cracks, irregular and coarse brush marks, sanding marks, blistering, non-uniformity of gloss level and other irregularities in the surface that are visible from a normal viewing position.","Set up the work area;

In general terms, this means that paint when correctly applied, i.e., not unnecessarily thinned, brushed out too thinly, or applied too heavily, will cover the area stated on the paint container provided that the surface is essentially non-absorbent. Where surfaces are
absorbent more paint will be used and it is difficult to assess paint usage requirements with a high degree of accuracy. The complete obliteration of the colour of a substrate will not necessarily occur with a single coat applied at the stated spreading rating.

Paintwork is defective if the application has blemishes such as paint runs, paint sags, wrinkling, dust, bare or starved painted areas, colour variations, surface cracks, irregular and coarse brush marks, sanding marks, blistering, non-uniformity of gloss level and other irregularities in the surface that are visible from a normal viewing position.","Set up the work area;

In general terms, this means that paint when correctly applied, i.e., not unnecessarily thinned, brushed out too thinly, or applied too heavily, will cover the area stated on the paint container provided that the surface is essentially non-absorbent. Where surfaces are
absorbent more paint will be used and it is difficult to assess paint usage requirements with a high degree of accuracy. The complete obliteration of the colour of a substrate will not necessarily occur with a single coat applied at the stated spreading rating.

Section 18 Spreading rate, paint coverage and paint usage

In general terms, this means that paint when correctly applied, i.e., not unnecessarily thinned, brushed out too thinly, or applied too heavily, will cover the area stated on the paint container provided that the surface is essentially non-absorbent. Where surfaces are
absorbent more paint will be used and it is difficult to assess paint usage requirements with a high degree of accuracy. The complete obliteration of the colour of a substrate will not necessarily occur with a single coat applied at the stated spreading rating.

NSW Defect Guide
13.2 Surface Finish of paintwork
Paintwork is defective if the application has blemishes such as paint runs, paint sags, wrinkling, dust, bare or starved painted areas, colour variations, surface cracks, irregular and coarse brush marks, sanding marks, blistering, non-uniformity of gloss level and other irregularities in the surface that are visible from a normal viewing position.","Setting up the work area;

Section 18 Spreading rate, paint coverage and paint usage

In general terms, this means that paint when correctly applied, i.e., not unnecessarily thinned, brushed out too thinly, or applied too heavily, will cover the area stated on the paint container provided that the surface is essentially non-absorbent. Where surfaces are
absorbent more paint will be used and it is difficult to assess paint usage requirements with a high degree of accuracy. The complete obliteration of the colour of a substrate will not necessarily occur with a single coat applied at the stated spreading rating.

13.2 Surface Finish of paintwork

Paintwork is defective if the application has blemishes such as paint runs, paint sags, wrinkling, dust, bare or starved painted areas, colour variations, surface cracks, irregular and coarse brush marks, sanding marks, blistering, non-uniformity of gloss level and other irregularities in the surface that are visible from a normal viewing position.","Set up the work area;

8.7 Moisture Management
Moisture ingress and condensation is one of the most common causes of defects in Australian buildings today. A drained and ventilated façade cavity is recognised as best practice in providing a high level of moisture management. The Vitradual details reflect this, with openings at top and bottom of walls designed to encourage air flow and allow the cavity to remove any condensation or other moisture.
Where an open cavity is not achievable (such as a window head or base of a fascia), it is recommended weep holes be provided. These are 10mm diameter, located 600mm apart. Note that in areas where there is no condensation risk weep holes may not be required.
Details 4,7 & 11 include provision for drainage of liquid water, this can be disregarded if the wall system adequately treats this elsewhere.

Section 18 Spreading rate, paint coverage and paint usage
In general terms, this means that paint when correctly applied, i.e., not unnecessarily thinned, brushed out too thinly, or applied too heavily, will cover the area stated on the paint container provided that the surface is essentially non-absorbent. Where surfaces are
absorbent more paint will be used and it is difficult to assess paint usage requirements with a high degree of accuracy. The complete obliteration of the colour of a substrate will not necessarily occur with a single coat applied at the stated spreading rating.

13.2 Surface Finish of paintwork
Paintwork is defective if the application has blemishes such as paint runs, paint sags, wrinkling, dust, bare or starved painted areas, colour variations, surface cracks, irregular and coarse brush marks, sanding marks, blistering, non-uniformity of gloss level and other irregularities in the surface that are visible from a normal viewing position.","Set up the work area;

5.4.5.1   General
Movement joints are discontinuities in the tiled surface, filled with permanently deformable material, which are intended to perform the following functions: 
(a) Separation of the tiled surface from fixed elements such as columns and walls.
(b) Subdivision of large areas of tiled surface into smaller sections to compensate for induced strain from various causes.
(c) To interrupt the tiled surface to match discontinuities in the substrate such as construction joints and movement joints.
It is essential that movement joints be carried through the tile and the bedding.

5.4.7   Bonding
In some installations, small hollow-sounding areas may be found. Although they do indicate
incomplete bond they are not necessarily indicative of imminent failure; however, cases
where more than 20% of the tile sounds hollow when tapped (‘drummy’) would have to be
considered suspect over the long term. Needless to say this ratio would need to be varied 
depending on—
(a) whether the tile is fixed to the floor or wall; and
(b) the anticipated form and amount of traffic.

5.4.5.1   General
Movement joints are discontinuities in the tiled surface, filled with permanently deformable material, which are intended to perform the following functions: 
(a) Separation of the tiled surface from fixed elements such as columns and walls.
(b) Subdivision of large areas of tiled surface into smaller sections to compensate for induced strain from various causes.
(c) To interrupt the tiled surface to match discontinuities in the substrate such as construction joints and movement joints.
It is essential that movement joints be carried through the tile and the bedding.

5.4.7   Bonding
In some installations small hollow-sounding areas may be found. Although they do indicate
incomplete bond they are not necessarily indicative of imminent failure; however, cases
where more than 20% of the tile sounds hollow when tapped (‘drummy’) would have to be
considered suspect over the long term. Needless to say this ratio would need to be varied 
depending on—
(a) whether the tile is fixed to the floor or wall; and
(b) the anticipated form and amount of traffic.

8.7 Moisture Management
Moisture ingress and condensation is one of the most common causes of defects in Australian buildings today. A drained and ventilated façade cavity is recognised as best practice in providing a high level of moisture management. The Vitradual details reflect this, with openings at top and bottom of walls designed to encourage air flow and allow the cavity to remove any condensation or other moisture.
Where an open cavity is not achievable (such as a window head or base of a fascia), it is recommended weep holes be provided. These are 10mm diameter, located 600mm apart. Note that in areas where there is no condensation risk weep holes may not be required.
Details 4,7 & 11 include provision for drainage of liquid water, this can be disregarded if the wall system adequately treats this elsewhere.

5.4.5   Movement joints
5.4.5.1   General
Movement joints are discontinuities in the tiled surface, filled with permanently deformable material, which are intended to perform the following functions: 
(a) Separation of the tiled surface from fixed elements such as columns and walls.
(b) Subdivision of large areas of tiled surface into smaller sections to compensate for induced strain from various causes.
(c) To interrupt the tiled surface to match discontinuities in the substrate such as construction joints and movement joints.
It is essential that movement joints be carried through the tile and the bedding.

incomplete bond they are not necessarily indicative of imminent failure; however, cases
where more than 20% of the tile sounds hollow when tapped (‘drummy’) would have to be
considered suspect over the long term. Needless to say this ratio would need to be varied
